            <p><strong>Buzz Buzz's Pollination Adventure with KIBO</strong> is an engaging activity where our young friends assisted Buzz Buzz in collecting pollen and returning it to the beehive. Buzz Buzz was unable to move on its own, so we utilized KIBO as a mode of transportation to carry him around.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>We remembered that KIBO is a robot, not a human, so we had to guide it with the directional programming blocks since it can't think on its own. We refreshed our understanding of the language KIBO employs – barcodes found on the blocks! We emphasized the importance of beginning with the start block and ending with the end block for KIBO to comprehend instructions accurately.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>We then delved into activity blocks such as shaking, turning to the side, moving backward and forward, and spinning. Then we started our activity. On the ground, we marked a tape line with the hive picture on one end and the flowers picture on the other. On the flower picture were yellow pom-poms representing the pollen.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>The task involved programming KIBO and Buzz Buzz to reach the flowers. Working in small groups, our children eagerly tackled the challenge. Initially, they tried using the forward block, but KIBO only managed to take a single step, falling short of reaching the flowers. They ingeniously overcame this by repeatedly pressing the button to advance KIBO step by step until Buzz Buzz reached the flowers, where they joyfully deposited the pollen. Subsequently, we introduced another method. We looked on a new block – the repeat block – explained its function. We counted the required repetitions until KIBO and Buzz Buzz reached the flowers, which turned out to be four times. We inserted the "four times" parameter card into the repeat block, and it worked like a charm.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Buzz Buzz had different ways to move: straight forward, or turning to the right or left. Each time, we had to find the right programming blocks for that action and place it in a sequence. Finally, we discussed the option of programming KIBO to perform the task continuously in the forever loop. When we programmed KIBO to do the task forever, the kids laughed a lot and had so much fun. Towards the end, I introduced the children to additional features of KIBO, such as its ear sensor for listening, the recorder for producing sound, its eye sensor for detecting light and darkness, and its telescopic function for gauging distances and its light bulb.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Our friends aimed to program KIBO to guide Buzz Buzz to flowers, gather pollen, and return to the hive. They explored KIBO's functions and experimented with directional blocks and repetition to optimize movement. Through trial and error, they fixed errors like missing start/end blocks or miscounting repetitions. This taught them the importance of precise coding and sequencing. Experimenting with repetition, they learned its efficiency in simplifying tasks, enhancing their computational thinking. Overall, the activity sharpened problem-solving, coding, and critical thinking skills, fostering curiosity and fun while preparing them for future STEM endeavors.</p>

            <p>"We love telling jokes in our Library. To enrich our joke telling skills with the use of KIBO, two students select a joke and then work together to create lines of code so that one KIBO with a puppet on top can begin a joke by asking a question like "What do you call a ______." The other student creates a line a code so that her KIBO with a puppet on top moves and replies with "I don't know. What do you call a _____." The first student creates a line of code to finish the joke and the other student can code her KIBO to move and laugh. This is a great way to learn the skill of having 2 KIBOs interact with each other, planning and executing lines of code that allow the KIBOs to "talk to each other" and having fun telling different types of jokes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My children demonstrated this. James and Kira are 10 year old twins in 4th grade. They found this activity challenging, but really fun. They had no prior exposure to KIBO, so I had to give them a little lesson before tackling this activity. One thing that we found super helpful was to clap two coding blocks together when using the "clap" block and Ear Sensor. This worked much better than actually clapping with your hands.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Enjoy! What jokes can you tell with KIBO?</strong></p>

            <p>In this activity, Our Block, Our Dance, let's teach KIBO some dance moves! Using KIBO's <a href="http://localhost:8080/shop/extensions" target="_blank" style="color: #8b5cf6; text-decoration: underline;">Advanced Coding Extension set</a>, Groups can create a dance step subroutine and create an icon on their programming block of their own to represent it. Groups will share their dance moves to teach them to different KIBOs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dancers often repeat patterns of movement when they dance. But they don't just repeat the same move over and over. They repeat patterns of movement. For example, a dancer might do a step, a turn, and a jump. Then they might repeat that pattern: step, turn, jump. The moves are like subroutines in the language of dance. The dance is like the main program in Cha-cha-cha dance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Have the kids dance along to a fun dance video with named moves. You might share a dance video where the caller names specific steps like the six-step or the "Whip Nae Nae" by Silentó. Have kids dance along to a fun dance video with named moves.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Children discuss what makes a superhero and engages children in discussions of leadership and decision-making. They can read <em>Everyday Super Hero</em> by by Sara Zuboff, then create their own superhero by decorating their KIBO robots with arts and crafts. They then program their KIBO to help people in some way.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This lesson incorporated lessons supporting community and SEL.</p>

        fullContent: `
            <p>This <em>Traditional Stories in Early Childhood Education – Teaching Stories through Robotics & Programming</em> curriculum was developed from one of our KIBO Ambassadors, Maribel Santos Miranda Pinto, where she shares a curricular unit for preschoolers – 4 to 7 years old.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Incorporating traditional children's stories, this curriculum integrates programming and robotics as the curricular theme and "powerful ideas". Using the story of the "3 Little Pigs", Maribel's learning objective is that children learn to program the KIBO robot, through the retelling of the story. This curriculum unit is linked to other subjects outside the STEM, because it starts with children's literature and goes through the construction of 3D scenarios using the work of artistic, plastic and musical expression, associated with the story.</p>
            <br>
            <p>"I believe that programming the KIBO Robot to tell a story will meet the interests of pre-school age children because, 'Children love to tell stories; they talk about what happened over the weekend, about family events, and about different happenings in the classroom. Each of these stories can be broken down into a sequence of activities. Teachers can ask targeted questions to help children extend these ideas. For example, a teacher might ask, \"What happened last?\" \"What happened first?\" and \"What happened in the middle?\"' (CSTA, 2016, p. 194).</p>
            <br>
            <p>The curriculum includes:</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 1: The Engineering Design Process in the traditional Story of the 3 Little Pigs</strong><br>
            Powerful Idea: Traditional stories for children and the Choice of the story the 3 Little Pigs – Robotics with the KIBO Robot</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 2: What Is A Robot?</strong><br>
            Powerful Idea: What is the character of the story that can be programmed in the Robot? – Robotics with the KIBO Robot</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 3: What is a Program?</strong><br>
            Powerful Idea: The 3 Little Pigs story, with The KIBO Robot (the \"Bad Wolf\") – Programming: Control Flow by Sequencing and Instructions to program</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 4: What Are Sensors?</strong><br>
            Powerful Idea: What are the 3 Little Pigs' Moments of History? – Learning with Sensors and Actuators</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 5: What Are Repeats?</strong><br>
            Powerful Idea: What does the Bad Wolf do? – Recount the entire history of the 3 little pigs using the Repeats: Loops & Number Parameters</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 6: What Are Ifs?</strong><br>
            Powerful Idea: Where is the Bad Wolf going? – Ifs – Sensors & Branches</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 7: Culminating Project</strong><br>
            Powerful Idea(s): \"The History and Dance of the 3 Little Pigs\" and Other Stories of Wolf in the Forest</p>

            <p>Our KIBO Ambassador, Marlene Gabriela Marques Fernandes, developed this 20-hour KIBO curriculum, "Dino Buddy", where young learners learn about dinosaurs through robotics and programming!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Using robotics as a learning facilitator, children will learn the correlation between dinosaurs with their environment, natural phenomena and their effects. They will learn how they lived on our planet millions of years ago.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This cross curricular lesson plan includes:</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 1: Study building</strong><br>
            Connection: Characteristics of dinosaurs<br>
            See the movie about the "Birth of the Earth" which provides information about the appearance, life and extinction of dinosaurs. Children will follow the steps of the engineering design process and draw the dinosaur they liked best and build it with Legos.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 2: What is a robot?</strong><br>
            Connection: Reinforce characteristics of dinosaurs, compare and contrast groups of them<br>
            Remember the different types of dinosaurs according to the environment in which they move: air, earth or water. Discover the various types of robots they know and their functions.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 3: What is a program?</strong><br>
            Connection: How do dinosaurs move? What are the physical characteristics of them?<br>
            Through creative and collaborative writing, tell a story of dinosaurs with which children identify themselves. Using apps will reproduce the steps that the main character will make during the story. Dramatize part of the story by programming the robot with simple commands.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 4: What are repeats?</strong><br>
            Connection: Dinosaurs<br>
            Discovering more dinosaur characteristics and continuing the collaborative story.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 5: What are sensors?</strong><br>
            Connection: How did the dinosaurs sense their friends and enemies? What senses did they have? Compare human and animal senses.<br>
            Discover how the dinosaurs knew friends and enemies. Remember the organs of the senses and compare them to the result of the research. Program the robot according to pre-established criteria, to react differently depending on the dinosaur it finds.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 6: What are ifs?</strong><br>
            Connection: Animal relationships<br>
            The dinosaurs are reptilian and therefore are oviparous. The children will participate in an eggs hunt, whose purpose is to discover, through the reactions of "DinoKIBO" and the criteria previously defined, to whom the egg belongs.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lesson 7: Final project</strong><br>
            Connection: Visit to the natural museum of Lourinhã Dino Park<br>
            The kids will go to the natural museum where they can learn more about dinosaur activities, such as watching fossil cleaning in the laboratory, and seeing time charts of the evolution of dinosaurs.</p>

            <p>How to Play KIBO Sight Word Bowling:</p>
            <br>
            <p>Have one set of sight word flashcards for the students to read from and have one set of the same words taped onto the bowling pins. Students will take turns reading the words and then trying to knock down the corresponding sight word pin using KIBO. I like to space the pins out a good bit so there is more space to knock down that particular pin not all of the pins. You also could do a "strike" where a student reads all the sight words and knocks down all of the pins. This game is diverse because you can do it in either reading or math. In math, use it to practice math facts or subitizing.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bowling Pins</li>
                <li>KIBO</li>

            <p>When making projects, engineers follow a series of steps called the Engineering Design Process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It has 6 steps:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <li>• ASK</li>

                <li>• and SHARE</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Engineering Design Process is a cycle – there's no official starting or ending point. You can begin at any step, move back and forth between steps, or repeat the cycle over and over!</p>

            <br>
            <p>— Create flags representing different countries, or come up with your own. Make a flag that represents your school, your town, or your family! If you have several KIBOs, make flags to represent different teams and then come up with challenges so that the teams can race!</p>
            <br>
            <p>— Install the flagpole on top of a stage support and the flag will fly proud. Install the flagpole on top of a motor and watch the flag spin around!</p>
            <br>
            <p>— If you have several KIBOs, install white boards on all of them (install on the "stage support" so the white boards don't spin). Write a letter on each white board. Then, program the KIBOs to create a word!</p>
            <br>
            <p>— Make KIBO look like a bird! Install the white board (horizontally or vertically) on the flag pole and use a motor so the white board will spin. Tape streamers to the edges of the white board, tape construction paper and put googly eyes on your "bird"</p>
            <br>
            <p>— Insert other decorated materials besides the white board into the "holders" of the flagpoles. You can use cardboard, playing cards, or even a mirror! See what interesting projects you can come up with when you use a mirror.</p>

            <p><strong>KIBO Bowling</strong> provides opportunities for measurement, prediction, and iteration in a fun goal-oriented activity. Contributor Todd Burleson writes:</p>
            <br>
            <p>"After students have had some practice creating programs, this is a fun way to develop mathematical and logical thinking skills. You can use ten objects of similar shape. I found these bowling pin sets at my local toy store. I had the students measure two meters away from the pins and place a tape line as the starting point. Students then built a program that moved KIBO down their 'lane.' They used tally marks to record the number of pins knocked down on their first attempt. Then, the students tweaked their program to try to get the remaining pins. Students explored starting KIBO at different spots along their starting line and adding turns, spins and even flashing lights for fun!"</p>

            <p>An awesome STEAM project is to make the KIBO draw. This fun STEAM experience opens a door for questions like "what drawing will this program make?" and "what program would we need to draw a particular shape?"</p>
            <br>
            <p>In this activity, kids attach a pen to the back of the KIBO using 5 clothespins as depicted and place KIBO on paper on the floor. And the game was on!</p>
            <br>
            <p>As KIBO moves around, kids can decide if they want KIBO to move in a regular way, e.g. in a square or circle, or drawing something funny. Or you might simply want to experiment! Once kids know what they want KIBO to draw, they then program KIBO with the wooden programming blocks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Kids test the program and see if it draws as they want. Did KIBO create the masterpiece they wanted?</p>

                <p>Ever thought "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" could munch its way through code? Well, buckle up for a coding journey! We're bringing the book to life, programming our caterpillar friend's feast. This adventure spans several classes, around 6 hours total, but hey, if we're having too much fun, who says we can't extend the fun? <strong>Let's dive in and see where our coding caterpillar takes us!</strong> All you need is: KIBO Robots, KIBO's Screen-free Programming Coding Blocks and Light Sensor.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: #87CEEB; font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Step 1: Read the Book Together</h3>
                
                <p>We read <em>The Hungry Hungry Caterpillar</em> by Eric Carle together. Once done I asked, "How is the caterpillar's search for food like a program?" Answers included, <em>there was a pattern; he was born, he ate, made a cocoon, and then became a butterfly; he ate more food each time, etc.</em></p>
                
                <p>I told the students we were going to use the repeat block and change the variable of times repeated each time.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #87CEEB; font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Step 2: Definitions</h3>
                
                <p><strong>TO DO:</strong> Ask students for a definition of a pattern.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Possible answers:</strong> something like shapes or numbers that repeats the same way.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SHOW:</strong> The Patterns found within the Very Hungry Caterpillar (see image).</p>
                
                <p><strong>TO DO:</strong> Ask students if this is a pattern or something else?</p>
                
                <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Answer:</strong> It is a pattern, but it's also a sequence, because there is a pattern, the numbers grow each time, but the fruit changes each time.</p>
                
                <p>(Have students attempt to create a sequence with their KIBO blocks. Students pair up so they have more blocks which makes the sequence more apparent.)</p>

                <h3 style="color: #87CEEB; font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Step 3: Whole Group Debugging</h3>
                
                <p>After two class periods of tinkering away, I start the next session by projecting our work and leading a discussion on its accuracy. We identify any hiccups in the code and troubleshoot together. Then, it's time for students to put their coding skills to the test as they program their own robots.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Differentiation:</strong> If any students are struggling with any aspect of the project, I may pair them with someone rather than working alone.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: #87CEEB; font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Step 4: Sequencing Together</h3>
                
                <p>We revisit the story to clarify the distinction between patterns and sequences. After reading, I project sequence pictures and we assemble the coding blocks collaboratively. Next class, I'll jog their memory and let them take the reins, scanning the blocks themselves. Let's keep the learning journey flowing smoothly!</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: #87CEEB; font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Step 5: Share</h3>
                
                <p>I've discovered that this step is crucial for my younger students. They absolutely love celebrating their successes, especially with such a potentially long term project. Once they've achieved their goals, if time permits, I'll have them line up their robots and press start together, creating a mini parade of accomplishment. It's a joyous moment that really boosts their confidence and camaraderie!</p>
